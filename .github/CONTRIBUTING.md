### How to make an Addition

You can add entries to this list by [submitting a request to Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrNN6YAp7zPwsNom), or by opening a pull request.

Get started by [editing](https://github.com/AdamXweb/awesome-aussie/edit/main/README.md) the readme, committing changes to your fork, and opening a pull request upstream to this repo's main branch.
If you are new to GitHub, [this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github/) may help you.

Your request will be reviewed, then either merged, or have changes requested, or if the [Guidelines](#guidelines) are not met, it may be closed with a comment explaining why. View this [good example of a quality pull request](https://github.com/AdamXweb/awesome-aussie/pull/33)

We are not accepting pull requests for the website at this stage. More info to come.

### Requirements

Software additions to this list, will usually need to meet the following requirements. 

- **Australian Based**
  - The provider must be based in Australia, or primarily serve the Australian market. - It should also be relatively easy to verify the co-founders are Australian based.
- **Relevant Category**
  - The startup / provider must fall into a relevant category to be in the main awesome list
- **Non-advertisement**
  - If the listing is for a general business, e-commerce store or non SaaS, it may be rejected from the list or placed into an alternative list.
  - Transparency. You must disclose if you are associated with the software / service.


_There may be some exceptions, but these would need to be fully justified and reviewed by the community. Usually these entries go within the "Extended List" section instead._

### Guidelines

Your pull request must follow these requirements. Failure to do so, might result in it being closed.


- Validating data; We use Linkedin, crunchbase and builtwith to validate data regarding HQ, business size and start date.
- Ensure your PR is not a duplicate, search for existing / previous submissions first
- Write short but descriptive git commit messages, under 50 characters. This must be in the format of `Adds [software-name] to [section-name]`. Your PR will be rejected if you name it `Updates README.md`
- You must respond to any comments or requests for changes in a timely manner, 48-hours maximum
- Only include a single addition / amendment / removal, per pull request
- If your pull request contains multiple commits, please squash them first
- You must complete each of the sections in the pull request template. Do not delete it!
- Where applicable, include links to supporting material for your addition: provider website, linkedin, crunchbase etc. This will make researching it much easier for reviewers
- While adding new software to the list, don't make your entry read like an advert. Be objective, and include drawbacks as well as strengths
- Your entry should be added at the bottom of the appropriate category, unless otherwise requested
- If there are other pull requests open, please help review them before submitting yours
- A pull request must receive multiple approval reviews before it can be merged

It's totally okay to submit your own projects as additions (providing they meet the requirements), but if you don't declare your association with that project then there becomes a clear conflict of interest
- You must adhere to the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
- Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the above guidelines when you open it
- Your changes must be correctly spelled, and with good grammar
- Your changes must be correctly formatted, in valid markdown
- The addition title must be a link the project, and in bold
- The addition description must be no less than 50, and no more than 250 characters, keep it clear and to the point
