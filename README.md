### Mirrors
The data is available here on Github, but is also mirrored to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/adamxweb/awesome-aussie)., and is syncable / downloadable as a CSV from [Airtable ](https://airtable.com/shrZWCu5DHbHFezJl).





### Airtable Integration Workflow
This branch stores the workflows to connect Github and Airtable. It provides the following functions:
- Syncing Github issues to Airtable. -> This allows the Airtable automations to quickly see if a new submission is a duplicate.
- Building the Readme from updated Airtable data and creating a pull request to update the main repository. -> Gathers the updates from Airtable and creates a pull request to update the README.
